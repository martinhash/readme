### :large_orange_diamond: The following compilation examples will be run with wintrillions

## Running

Run `ng serve --configuration=wintrillions` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project does not run the normal HTML, only the implementation of extensions of the different applications integrated in environment files.


## Production

1.  Run `npm run build --configuration=wintrillions.production` to build the project for production.

## SSR Prerender

- Run `ng run ng-multisite:prerender` to execute Angular Universal express engine [Prerender](https://github.com/angular/universal).

## Run Progressive Web App Installable in mobile and desktop.

- Run `ng build --configuration=wintrillions.production` to execute a normal build in production and install  express engine [Prerender](https://github.com/angular/universal).

### Now you can install the application on your platform mobile or desktop.

By default, the production build uses a service worker generated by NGSW ([Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started)).
